## About Me

I am a PhD student at the
[School of Computer and Communication Sciences (IC)](http://ic.epfl.ch/),
[EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch/), Switzerland. I am a doctoral research assistant at
[NLP](https://nlp.epfl.ch/) and [LSIR](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lsir/) labs
under supervision of [Prof. Antoine Bosselut](https://atcbosselut.github.io/)
and [Prof. Karl Aberer](https://people.epfl.ch/karl.aberer?lang=en).
Currently, I am doing a 4-month research internship at Google Research, Zurich.

**NEW: I'm on the job market, looking for a position starting in the Fall of 2025.**

## Research Interests

My research interests broadly encompass natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, with a particular focus on improving the multilingual capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially in low-resource settings.
I work across the entire pipeline of training multilingual LLMs, including:
<!-- constructing high-quality pretraining datasets (language identification, filtering, and preprocessing), designing effective multilingual data mixtures, developing language-aware tokenization and architectures, and curating robust multilingual evaluation datasets. My current research focus is: -->
- **Pretraining Data Construction:** Language identification, data filtering, and preprocessing to ensure high-quality datasets.
- **Multilingual Data Mixtures:** Designing effective data strategies for balanced language representation.
- **Language-Aware Tokenization & Architectures:** Developing multilingual tokenizers and LLMs that better handle low-resource languages.
- **Robust Multilingual Evaluation:** Curating robust benchmarks to assess model performance across languages.
