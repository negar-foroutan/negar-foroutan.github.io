## About Me

I am a research scientist at Google Research, Zurich, Switzerland.
I recently completed my PhD at
[School of Computer and Communication Sciences (IC)](http://ic.epfl.ch/),
[EPFL](http://www.epfl.ch/), under supervision of [Prof. Antoine Bosselut](https://atcbosselut.github.io/) and [Prof. Karl Aberer](https://people.epfl.ch/karl.aberer?lang=en).


## Research Interests

My research interests broadly encompass natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, with a particular focus on improving the multilingual capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially in low-resource settings.
I work across the entire pipeline of training multilingual LLMs, including:
- **Pretraining Data Construction:** Language identification, data filtering, and preprocessing to ensure high-quality datasets.
- **Multilingual Data Mixtures:** Designing effective data strategies for balanced language representation.
- **Language-Aware Tokenization & Architectures:** Developing multilingual tokenizers and LLMs that better handle low-resource languages.
- **Robust Multilingual Evaluation:** Curating robust benchmarks to assess model performance across languages.
